I'm pleased to announce a new version of Cubian is out. The version name is **X1**. It's highly recommended to upgrade to this version. It resolved all the known problems in the previous releases.

The new version supports all cubieboards currently released by cubietech. HDMI and VGA image is separately packed for the sake of convience. <small>Our wiki has a great tutorial on [how to use VGA output](https://github.com/cubieplayer/Cubian/wiki/VGA-output)</small>.

Cubian is dedicated to make Debian running on cubieboard **easier, faster, safer**. It has three types to suit your needs.

* **Nano** text mode
* **Nano+headless** text mode but without display support, no reserved memory.
* **Desktop** [MATE desktop](http://mate-desktop.org/) with hardware acceleration, chromium browser with flash support

<p></p>
Please read [Get started with Cubian](https://github.com/cubieplayer/Cubian/wiki/Get-started-with-Cubian) if you are first on using Cubian. The rules still working if you aren't customize anything.
Read [Install Cubian](https://github.com/cubieplayer/Cubian/wiki/Install-Cubian) if you don't know how to install.

#Hilights
* Cubian X1 has a configuration tool called `cubian-config`. It is adopted from [raspi-config](http://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/raspi-config.md). It will run at first boot, let you choose your password, locales, timezone, keyboard layout and more.

# One more thing
We use bittorrent to publish the new images to saving money on hosting charges. **Kindly please help seeding at least 30 minutes after your download is complete to make others downloading faster**. I aslo use my cubieboard as a seeder (with cubian x1 of course XD) at home working all days.
