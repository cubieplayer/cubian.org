Cubian is a battle tested os on cubieboard now, just look at the [issue tracking system](https://github.com/cubieplayer/Cubian/issues). **Clean** and **simple** are its philosophy. 

This release contains the following features, I hope you enjoy it:

* Kernel upgrade to 3.4.67+ which is the latest one at current
* U-Boot is upgraded to speed up the booting process
* More wifi modules supports
* Preinstalled [Ajenti](http://ajenti.org), a web administration tool
* Preinstalled [udevil](http://ignorantguru.github.io/udevil)

# Showtime
Load average in idle state is very nice.

[Ajenti](http://ajenti.org/) web control panel. The login credential is **root**:**admin**.  
**Notice**: As you can see the free space is only 26MB, I recommends you use [cubian-resizefs](http://cubian.org/2013/08/12/enlarge-cubian-rootfs-partition/) to expand the spaces.

# One more thing
Cubian will have a desktop version soon, I am working hard on it currently. What i can tell you is it is really amazing.
