If you like Cubian and want to make a donation. You can do it if you have a github eligible account.

A eligible github account is:

1. registered before *1 MAY,2013*
2. has commited some code

# Steps

1. Open <https://giveaway.ripple.com/> and Login with your github account.  
    If you see *You are eligible for one giveaway code, Just A few more steps...* That means your github account is eligible to donate cubian, now go to step 2.  
    If you see other than that, I'm still thanks for your kindness and effort. But you can't donate cubian by this way.
2. Please copy and paste **ramPzfegGYq2aX1GU18B5JVGiYQTtWfhyz** to the first text input box. This is a virtual address to recieve your donation.  
    You can type anything to the passphrase fileds or just use the random one. it's not important at all.
3. Click *Get your code*, then you will recieve a giveway code. You can send this code to e-mail address
    **donate.cubian@gmail.com**  
    The code doesn't contains any privacy information and it is binded to the reciever's address. So, you can simply leave a comment contains the code to this article if sending an email is not easy.
